## Installation

To use the Molecule AI Forex Software, follow these steps:

1. Download the MoleculeAIFunctions.mqh file and place it in your MetaTrader 5 installation directory under the 'MQL5\Include' folder.

2. Copy the code from the MoleculeAI.mq5 file and paste it into a new Expert Advisor in MetaEditor.

3. Compile the code and attach the Expert Advisor to a chart in MetaTrader 5.

4. Set up the trading parameters according to your preferences by modifying the global variables in the code:

   - `g_LotSize`: Initial lot size for trading.
   - `g_StopLoss`: Stop loss level in pips.
   - `g_TakeProfit`: Take profit level in pips.
   - `g_MaximumPositions`: Maximum number of open positions.

5. Once the Expert Advisor is running, it will automatically execute trades based on the trade signals generated by the Molecule AI algorithm.

## Usage

The Molecule AI Forex Software is designed to automatically execute trades based on the trade signals generated by the algorithm. The algorithm analyzes market data and generates trade signals which are then executed by the Expert Advisor.

The Expert Advisor will check for trade signals on each tick. If a buy signal is generated (`g_TradeSignal == 1`), the Expert Advisor will open a buy position. If a sell signal is generated (`g_TradeSignal == -1`), the Expert Advisor will open a sell position.

## Customization

The Molecule AI Forex Software can be customized according to your trading preferences. The following functions can be modified to suit your needs:

- `InitializeTradingFunctions()`: Implement necessary trading function initialization.
- `LoadAlgorithmVersion(string versionDate)`: Load the specified version of the algorithm.
- `SetTradeParameters(double lotSize, double stopLoss, double takeProfit, int maxPositions)`: Set up trading parameters.
- `OpenPosition(int type)`: Open a position based on the specified trade type.
